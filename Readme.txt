#Prediction of offensive language on social media

This is an automated model trained to predict whether a tweets is offensive, hate speech or neither.

Digital bullying is happening on a daily basis and all of us are facing in form or another on social media.

Proposing a solution to tackle this problem by generating an automated tool that uses ML algorithmns and NLP techniques to detect these offensive languages on social media in three classes.

###Tools and technology used:
Scikit Learn
NLTK
Pandas
Matplotlib

###Classifiers trained or experimented on
Logistic Regression
Gaussian NB
Random forest classifier
SVM

###Results
Random Forest model has outperformed all the other models and the results are as follows for each level of classification.
Random Forest, Accuracy Score: 0.8950978414363526

Predicting whether the tweet is Hate speech:
f1-score: 0.21

Predicting whether the tweet is Offensive speech:
f1-score: 0.94

Predicting whether the tweet is neither :
f1-score: 0.84

###Installation and Execution
Your python envirmonment should be installed with proper libraries such as Scikit_learn, NLTK, Pandas, MatPlotLib. You can pip or brew commands depending on the machine you are using to download these libaries.
